    "This remote sensing measurements can be performed either by planes or by satellites. The latter can provide radar information up to 14 time a day as in the case of [Sentinel-1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-1). The C-Band radar manage to capture data in numerous conditions (e.g. darkness, rain, cloud, fog, etc.) and measures the energy reflected back called backscatter (Torres et al, 2012). Those data can latter be analyzed and used to clear out potential collision between icebergs and ships. \n",

    "Building on the top of recent advances in the field of signal processing on graphs (Schuman et al., 2013) and deep learning on irregular domains (Bronstein et al., 2017), we investigate the performance of standard machine learning methods and the relevance of graph based convolutional neural networks to perform binary classification in this specific case. The new method provide a convenient way of getting rotational invariance over the data and set up a flexible framework for structured pooling (Defferrard et al., 2017). Pooling operations require adequate aggregation by coarsening the graph between layers. We experiment how this framework can be exploited through various processes: Graclus multilevel algorithm, ...
