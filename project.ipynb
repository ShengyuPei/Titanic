The second can provide radar information up to 14 time a day as in the case of [Sentinel-1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-1). The C-Band radar manages to capture data in numerous conditions (e.g. darkness, rain, cloud, fog, etc.) and measures the energy reflected back called backscatter (Torres et al, 2012). Those data can later be analyzed and used to clear out potential collision between icebergs and ships. \n",

The new method provide a convenient way of getting rotational invariance over the data (Defferrard et al., 2017) and set up a flexible framework for structured pooling. \n",

For the KNN, the score is quite high, especially the recall, which is desirable for our application (classifying some ships as icebergs is not so problematic, but we do not want to miss any iceberg).\n",

    "While those neural network models are quite good accouting for the high noise and few data, the graph based models are better in some aspects. In particular, the precision score of `gcnn_grid` with only a single band is high, but it does have some lower recall. `gcnn_kwraps` achieve even a surprising recall. Overall, the standard convolutional model is the most balanced one with f1 score being the highest of all models. Thus, graph convolutional model provided interesting alternative to standard methods on some aspect. More tuning and more data would be required to draw some conclusion."

    "\n",
    "To sum up, we first had a look on the dataset to inspect and explore possible analysis directions. We then preprocessed it for later usage. The next step was to review possible graphs models and their coarsening. On the four coarsening methods presented, we used only Graclus as it was the best tradeoff between complexity and usage (permutation are linear). AMG provide an interesting alternative but we could not afford its long running time in the final notebook. We finally compare standard machine learning models, convolutional neural networks and various graph convolutional neural network to see whether the latter bring novelty and new insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, as training and hyperparameter tuning time take a lot of time, we decided to select `gcnn_grid` and `gcnn_kwraps` for the final comparison. The `gcnn_knn` was indeed already compared in previous work and the selected one show interesting points. The graph models show a high variance in the training with sudden jump. Regularizations helped a bit to stabilize, however we decided to go without in order not to introduce difference between learning schemes. Some challenges were moreover faced as we had access to only 1000 labels and more data would be required to performed a fine-tuned and perfectly fair comparison.\n",

    "Thus, deep learning on irregular domains can help to save lifes but further research and work is required."
